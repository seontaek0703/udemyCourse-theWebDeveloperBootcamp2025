    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Cuttlefish, or cuttles, are marine <a href="#">molluscs</a> of the suborder Sepiina. They
      belong to the class Cephalopoda which also includes squid, octopuses, and
      nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which
      is used for control of buoyancy.

    <h2>appearance</h2>

    <p>
      Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles
      furnished with denticulated suckers, with which they secure their prey.
      They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the
      largest species, the giant cuttlefish (Sepia apama), reaching 50 cm (20
      in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass.

    <h2>feed</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopuses, worms, and
      other cuttlefish. Their predators include dolphins, larger fish (including
      sharks), seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The typical life
      expectancy of a cuttlefish is about 1â€“2 years. Studies are said to
      indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent invertebrates.

      Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all
      invertebrates. The Greco-Roman world valued the cuttlefish as a source of
      the unique brown pigment the creature releases from its siphon when it is
      alarmed. The word for the cuttlefish in both Greek and Latin, sepia, now
      refers to the reddish-brown color sepia in English.
